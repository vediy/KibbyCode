Submission to the Congressional App Challenge, 2025.

Official project name: "KibbyCode: City Sim"

Project contributors: Ved Iyer, Round Rock High School


This app is designed to benefit anyone who is interested in learning programming but doesn't have the patience to sit down and learn through boring lectures. Instead, we made it a city-building simulator experience, where you are building your own city and solving its problems through programming. This engaging experience is welcome to new coders and encourages users to make mistakes to learn.
